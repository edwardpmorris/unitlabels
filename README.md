# unitlabels
A R package to help with formatting parameter and unit labels for insertion in R, Rmarkdown and LaTeX

## Status
A basic version of the concept is now more or less working.

## To do

+ change to a S3 or S4 type; make a class for storing unitlabels and the functions into methods
+ provide more flexibility and ease of use in terms of users defining label lists
+ look into ways of acessing online resources for quantity names and units (such as CF standards)
+ integrate with 'udunits2'
