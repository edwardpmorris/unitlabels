When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, results='asis'}
require(unitlabels)
def <- system.file("extdata", package = "unitlabels")
def <- paste0(def,"/definitions.csv")
def <- read.csv(def, as.is = T)
cat(def$sh.symbol)
cat(uls(def$sh.symbol,"md"))
cat(def$sh.units)
cat(ulu(def$sh.units,"md"))
def.comb <- paste(def$sh.symbol, def$sh.units,sep=".")
cat(ul(def.comb,"md"))

```

```{r}
labs <- ul(def.comb)
plot(1:10,1:10, pch="")
labs
text(seq(1,10,length.out =39),rep(1:9+1,39/6),labs, cex=0.7)

```
